# Password Manager (Cryptography Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a simple and secure Password Manager developed for the Cryptography course. The goal is to apply cryptographic concepts to build a secure system that stores and manages user passwords.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Implement secure password encryption (AES / ChaCha20)
- Use a master password with hashing + salt
- Store encrypted passwords safely
- Provide basic operations: Add, View, Update, Delete
- Follow clean code and security best practices
